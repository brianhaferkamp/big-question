      <p>The Big Question lets you express your thoughts about the biggest questions of our day. Your answers aren't tracked. No answer is attached to an IP address, URL, or email address. Each answer is anonymously stored in a database file with a random key name. This allows you to freely answer the question without it following you around Internet or haunting you for the rest of your life. The whole point of this project is to promote the free, anonymous exchange of ideas.</p>
      <p>It's possible that this experiment could go horribly wrong. Here are some community rules that might keep us from having to shut down this experiment.</p>
      <p> <b>Community Rules</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep cursing to a minimum. Use those words for emphasis, not as adjectives.</li>
        <li>Communicate your answer clearly. Don't put down others. This is about you and your thoughts, not them.</li>
        <li>Answer honestly. No one's tracking you so be honest with your answers.</li>
        <li>Don't respond to the answers left by others. It's not a conversation or comment section. Write your answer so that it stands on its own.</li>
        <li>Don't promote any agendas. It doesn't add to the answers and it's annoying.</li>
        <li>Don't call people out by name. Make this about you and your thoughts, not others. </li>
      </ul>
